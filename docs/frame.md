# Relic: Frame

The locked frame for the Relic run. Every later station inherits it. If a station needs something here to be different, that's drift and it routes back to this station. Nobody redefines it quietly downstream.

## What Relic is

A zero-knowledge publishing service driven by an MCP tool. You tell your coding agent to publish a file as a relic (named relic, not artifact, because Claude already has Artifacts). A local stdio MCP server generates a random secret on your machine, encrypts the file in-process, and uploads only ciphertext to a service backed by Google Cloud Storage. You share `https://<relic-domain>/{id}#{secret}`. URL fragments are never transmitted to a server, so the operator never receives the key. A PWA fetches the ciphertext, decrypts it in the browser, and renders it by mimetype under a branded taskbar.

## Locked constraints

Settled before this document. Recorded, not reopened.

1. **No server-returned executable script.** The local stdio MCP server holds the key and encrypts in-process. CVE-2025-6514 earned CVSS 9.6 for the accidental version of exactly the shape a returned script would make deliberate ([JFrog](https://jfrog.com/blog/2025-6514-critical-mcp-remote-rce-vulnerability/)). The constraint binds the publish path: the server hands the agent no code to run, and that half stands unreversed. It was never a promise that the usercontent frame executes nothing, because executing untrusted content is that frame's job; JSX rendering arrives there and is recorded with its cost in the value section and the non-goals, not smuggled past this rule.
2. **Relic doesn't run under `thebushido.co`.** It needs two registrable domains distinct from it: one for the service, one for the usercontent origin that renders untrusted HTML. Google flagged every subdomain of `immich.cloud` over per-PR preview environments, including internal-only services, then flagged it again after a successful appeal ([Immich](https://immich.app/blog/google-flags-immich-as-dangerous)).
3. **Rendering is the wedge. Zero-knowledge is the permission slip.**

A note on a word, so nobody reintroduces it: the origin that renders untrusted
HTML was previously called the sandbox and is now the usercontent origin, named
after `googleusercontent.com` and `githubusercontent.com`. The rename happened
because "sandbox" reads as a preproduction environment, which cost real
confusion; the origin is permanent architecture. The iframe's `sandbox`
attribute and the `sandbox.html` document still say sandbox, because there the
word names the frame mechanism, not the origin.

## The problem

Your agent made something a person needs to look at, and there's no good way to hand it over.

The report, the diff summary, the generated chart, the scraped dataset. It lives on a machine the reader can't reach, in a format a chat window flattens into garbage. Today you paste it into Slack and it truncates, zip it and email it and the gateway strips it, push a gist and lose the rendering, or screenshot it and lose the text.

Claude's Artifacts solves this once, for one path. Source file types are restricted to `.html`, `.htm`, and `.md`, with a 16 MiB rendered cap and a strict CSP blocking external requests. It requires a claude.ai-authenticated session on Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise. It's **off by default in Agent SDK, GitHub Action, and MCP-server contexts**, and sessions using an API key, gateway token, or cloud-provider credential can't publish at all ([Claude Code docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/artifacts), [Anthropic support](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/9547008-publish-and-share-artifacts)). For a large share of agent runs there's no publish button in the product at all.

## The user

Two segments, both defined by the absence of a first-party path rather than by dissatisfaction with one.

**Headless and CI agent runs producing a report a human must read.** The trigger is a nightly job, a PR check, or a scheduled audit finishing with output someone has to see. Artifacts are off by default in Agent SDK and GitHub Action contexts, and API-key sessions can't publish at all, so there's no first-party path whatsoever. Today they dump it to the job log, commit it to a branch nobody opens, or upload a CI artifact behind a login the recipient doesn't have. The cleanest segment, because the alternative isn't a worse tool. It's nothing.

**Developers on non-Claude agents.** Cursor, Codex, Copilot, Cline, Windsurf, Aider, Amp. Same trigger, an agent finishing something worth showing, and none of them has a publish button anywhere. Today they run the paste-and-truncate loop above.

Explicitly ruled out: **orgs that disabled Artifacts for compliance.** An org that blocked Artifacts on policy won't approve an unvetted third-party domain either. Not a segment, just a longer sales cycle ending in no.

## The value

The wedge is opinionated, mimetype-aware rendering of agent output, and it holds because no competitor occupies that ground. file.kiwi ships client-side AES-GCM, key-in-fragment, no account, no size limit, 96-hour expiry, **and an MCP server**, free ([file.kiwi](https://file.kiwi/), [server](https://github.com/file-kiwi/filekiwi-mcp-server)). PrivateBin has shipped the identical construction since 2012 ([PrivateBin](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin)). So neither the crypto nor agent-native publishing is defensible ground. What none of them do is render the thing well. Zero-knowledge is what *permits* adoption inside a company, letting a developer answer "am I allowed to send our internal report through a third party" without booking a security review. Nobody picks a tool for that. They're merely allowed to pick one.

**Honesty constraint, non-negotiable.** The JavaScript that performs the decryption is served by the same server the zero-knowledge claim is made against, and that server could ship different JavaScript tomorrow. It's a claim about operator intent, not a property a recipient can verify. PrivateBin's threat model says this out loud ([threat model](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/wiki/Threat-Model)) and Relic says it too. Overclaiming here is a reputational liability with no upside.

**A second honesty constraint, which JSX rendering created and closing egress resolved.** The usercontent frame renders untrusted HTML, and now JSX as well, and the first recorded answer to that capability was parity: rendered content kept the network reach HTML has always had, and the disclosure said so, which meant whoever authored a relic could learn the recipient's IP, user agent, and open time by pointing that reach at a host they controlled. That decision is reversed on owner instruction, and the reversal is recorded in `docs/decisions.md`. The frame's response now carries a CSP that permits no remote source of any kind: rendered content cannot fetch, cannot load external images or fonts, cannot open a WebSocket or EventSource, and cannot beacon. React is bundled into the frame's own inlined bundle, and nothing is fetched from a CDN. Inlining is the only option, for a structural reason: the frame is sandboxed without `allow-same-origin`, so it runs in an opaque origin, and in an opaque origin `'self'` matches nothing, meaning the frame cannot fetch even its own assets. What an author's relic can do now is execute locally and reach nothing, and the origin boundary still prevents the key: rendered content executes on an opaque origin that can never read the fragment on the viewing origin. The cost is named rather than absorbed: a published page that references a CDN stylesheet, a CDN script, an external font, or a remote image renders without it, and publishers must inline what their page needs. The published `/policy` disclosure states the block plainly, while the viewer carries a compact marker in the header chrome stating the page runs the author's code with a link to that policy.

## The success metric

One primary metric, both halves required:

> **A majority of published relics are opened by someone other than the publisher, and a majority of those opened relics are of a type Relic renders rather than download-only binaries.**

If the second clause fails, Relic is a worse file.kiwi and the value case is false.

Neither half is measurable by default. The server holds only ciphertext and never receives the key. Mimetype sniffing happens after decryption, in the browser. The viewing origin carries no analytics, because any same-origin script can read `location.hash`. Left alone, "opens by rendered type" degrades into "opens," the one number that can't detect the failure it exists to detect.

### The minimum telemetry that restores measurability

All server-side. None of it needs a script on the viewing origin.

1. **A coarse renderer class declared at publish time by the local client**, which holds the plaintext: one of `markdown`, `code`, `html`, `jsx`, `image`, `media`, `archive`, `binary`. Stored server-side against the relic ID, and redeclared by every republish, so the row always carries the current version's class. The field was introduced for operator telemetry, but its audience now includes the recipient: it is served in link unfurl metadata (`og:description`, `twitter:description`, and the fallback `<title>`). A blank card on an unfamiliar domain is the visual shape of a phishing link, and a recipient deciding whether to open a link is better served knowing it is an archive than knowing nothing.
2. **Open counts taken at signed-URL mint time.**
3. **Publishing client name**, so "does this serve the segments Artifacts cannot" is answerable at all.
4. **An optional publisher-declared plaintext title**, defaulting to the source filename, stored server-side on the relic row and served in link unfurls and viewer `<title>`.

**How each half is computed.** First clause: of the relics published in a period, the share with at least one open surviving the publisher filters below. Second clause: the class is stored against the relic ID and every open event names that ID, so joining them gives the class distribution of the *opened* population rather than the published one, and the share landing in `{markdown, code, html, jsx, image}` is the number. The class travels with the current version, because republish exists: a new version declares a fresh class alongside its ciphertext, and the row carries the current version's declaration. The taxonomy cuts on the wedge boundary, renderable `{markdown, code, html, jsx, image}` against download-only `{media, archive, binary}`, so the second clause is computable with no ambiguity. The first isn't, and the rest of this section is why.

One consequence of versioning for this clause, stated so nobody reads the old derivation back in: the class used to be immutable for a relic's life, because one relic had exactly one plaintext. That basis reversed with the republish non-goal, and what survives the reversal is the part that matters to the metric: the join measures the class of what the recipient actually saw, which is the current version's declaration, which is the question the clause exists to ask.

### The confound in the first clause, which is permanent

Separating a recipient's open from the publisher's own is not fully solvable under the locked non-goals. An identified opener would solve it. Identity exists in the product now, but it attaches to commenting and never to opening, so an open still arrives anonymous and the confound survives the reversal. So this gets documented, never engineered away.

**Two filters, both partial.** The baseline filter drops opens whose requesting IP matches the relic's publishing IP, both of which the server already sees. The second drops opens minted within 120 seconds of publish: a pure time delta between the publish timestamp and the mint timestamp, computed server-side, needing nothing from the viewing origin. Treat 120 seconds as a provisional value set by judgment. A later station moves it once there's real data.

**The asymmetry runs both directions, and only one is safe.** IP exclusion undercounts harmlessly: a genuine recipient behind the publisher's NAT gets dropped, which can only make you believe you lost when you won. The dangerous direction is the publisher opening their own relic from cellular, a VPN, or a second machine, which counts as a recipient and inflates the exact clause the metric rests on. Not a corner case here. Relic ships a PWA whose point is mobile viewing, and checking your own link before sending it is the most likely thing a publisher does.

**What the time window fails to catch.** It shaves the dominant false positive, the immediate self-check from a second device, and leaves residue both ways. It misses a publisher who checks twice, and the publisher who sends the link and then opens it on a phone five minutes later, which is precisely the mobile-PWA behavior the product encourages. At the other end, when a publisher never self-checks, the window eats a genuinely fast first recipient open. Tuning the number trades one direction for the other. It doesn't remove either.

**The trust condition.** An open carries no identity, so the condition is stated in what the server can see: relic volume and distinct publishing IPs. Below roughly 100 relics per week, or while a single publishing IP accounts for most of them, the first clause isn't informative and doesn't get reported as a result. That covers the whole dogfooding period, when the collective is the dominant publisher, self-checks dominate the sample, and the clause would otherwise read green in the world where Relic has zero recipients. The 100 is provisional too, a placeholder until the real distribution is visible. Report it as instrumentation health, never as evidence.

**The first clause can't be made fully trustworthy under this architecture.** It's a directional indicator with a known inflation bias, and it gets read as one.

Two further limits. This measures the *type* of what was opened, never whether rendering succeeded, because render success would need a viewing-origin script. Nobody downstream reads it as proof the renderer worked. And the confound touches only the first clause. The second is substantially robust to publisher self-opens, because a publisher self-checks relics drawn from the same publishing population, so the failure it exists to detect (most relics are binaries) still shows through. The sharper half of the metric is the half the confound damages least.

### The cost of the telemetry

This leaks a coarse content category, a client name, IP-correlated open activity, and an optional publisher-declared plaintext title to the operator, and it now discloses the coarse renderer class and optional title to anyone who fetches the link. The operator still cannot read a byte of the encrypted content, but the title and class are stored in the clear. What the operator learns: the coarse renderer class, the publishing client, open counts, and the plaintext title of the content or source filename. What it buys the recipient: a legible link preview card revealing what kind of thing the link holds instead of a blank card on an unfamiliar domain, which is the visual shape of a phishing link. A recipient deciding whether to open a link is better served knowing it is an archive than knowing nothing. What it costs the publisher: the coarse renderer class and optional title are stored server-side and served to anyone fetching `/{id}` without the key. The title can be declined: the publisher can pass an empty title or clear it on republish, falling back to per-class fallback metadata (such as `An archive relic` or `A Markdown relic`). The class is derived from the bytes by the publishing client and is not declinable. Publishers must be able to see all of it in a published privacy statement before they publish. Upload IP and timestamp are already retained for abuse response, so the IP-correlation cost is largely pre-existing.

### Supporting conditions

Three, each checkable, none primary.

1. **The service domain stays unflagged** by Safe Browsing, VirusTotal consensus, and the major mail-gateway blocklists. Checked on a schedule against every registrable domain, all verified in Search Console before launch ([Google](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6347750)). Only the public lists answer a scheduled query. A block inside a single company's mail tenant isn't visible from outside, so that half surfaces as a recipient reporting a dead link rather than as a check going red. This one differs in kind from the others: failing it means shut it down, not tune it.
2. **The publishing client distribution includes headless, CI, and non-Claude clients**, rather than only interactive Claude Code. Computable from telemetry item 3, and only as good as it: a CI run and an interactive run can report the same client name, so the headless half holds only where the client says so itself. If it's all interactive Claude Code, Relic is serving the audience that already has Artifacts.
3. **Egress spend stays under the kill-switch ceiling.** Read off the billing export.

Abuse-response conditions belong to `frame-preconditions` and aren't listed here.

## The standing assumption that could invalidate this frame

Both segments derive entirely from a capability gap in a product Anthropic controls. That window isn't permanent, and pretending otherwise defers wrong-thing risk instead of killing it.

**The assumption:** Artifacts stay unavailable to headless and non-interactive agent contexts, and stay restricted to `.html`, `.htm`, and `.md`.

**The falsifying trigger:** Artifacts becoming available in Agent SDK or GitHub Action contexts, or accepted source file types widening beyond `.html`/`.htm`/`.md`. Either one alone is enough.

Hitting either trigger changes the problem instead of adding a detail to absorb downstream. It routes back to this station as drift. Whoever notices it first says so rather than quietly rescoping around it.

## The wedge boundary

Rendering is the wedge, so the frame bounds it or the wedge is unbounded. This is a value decision and it's urgent, because in-page archive browsing works only if the crypto framing supports range decryption, and that choice is irreversible once content is encrypted. `shape` picks the wire format and needs this signal first.

**First release renders:** Markdown (rendered, with a source toggle), code and plain text (syntax highlighted), HTML (on the usercontent origin), JSX (on the usercontent origin, executed there after transpiling on the service origin), and still images. Everything else is download-only in the first release.

That set is exactly `{markdown, code, html, jsx, image}`, exactly the renderable side of the telemetry taxonomy. No gap between what the metric counts as renderable and what the first release renders. If one slips, the taxonomy moves with it and the metric is restated. Same decision.

**The value case requires range-decryptable framing regardless.** In-page archive browsing and seekable media are precisely the payloads Artifacts can't carry, which is the whole reason this product exists. They're out of the first release and inside the value case. `unzipit` can avoid downloading a whole ZIP when the server supports HTTP range requests ([unzipit](https://github.com/greggman/unzipit)), and `wormhole-crypto` implements `decryptStreamRange` over RFC 8188 framing ([wormhole-crypto](https://github.com/SocketDev/wormhole-crypto)), so the capability exists off the shelf. The constraint `shape` inherits is about reversibility, not about building the feature now: **don't choose a wire format that forecloses range decryption.** Ship without archive browsing. Don't make it impossible.

## Non-goals

These bound every later station. Anything here showing up in a downstream design is drift.

- **Accounts exist, in exactly one form: a verified email address per commenter, and the address is the identity.** This reverses the original non-goal that there was no identity anywhere in the product, and the reversal is recorded rather than absorbed: the old entry said no sign-up, no sign-in, no identity anywhere, and what makes identity workable here is that the mechanism stops at reachability. A commenter enters an email address, receives a magic link, and following that link verifies the address. The verified address is the identity; a display name is optional and aliases it rather than replacing it, so names are decoration and the address is the record. There is no password, no profile, and no session left behind to log into. Publishing and opening stay anonymous: no publish, republish, or open carries an identity, and the republish token below stays a bearer credential rather than a login. What it buys is the feature that cannot exist without it, comments and markup that people leave, that other people see, and that an agent can read back and act on, all of which have to attach to somebody, because a comment attributed to nobody is one nobody can answer or trust. What it costs is stated in full, because most of it is unrecoverable the moment the first message is sent, and what it does not license is stated with it:
  - **Magic-link delivery necessarily processes the plaintext address.** You cannot send mail to a hash. The raw address exists in application memory, in request logs unless they are deliberately scrubbed, in the mail provider's records, in bounce handling, and plausibly in error tracking. A salted hash in the datastore does not undo any of that and must never be presented as though it does.
  - **A salted hash is not a one-way door for this data.** Email addresses are low-entropy, and `first.last@company.com` has a tiny plausible space. A per-record salt defeats rainbow tables and does nothing against targeted guessing, and an operator holding the salt can enumerate a candidate list in bulk rather than merely confirming a single guess. That is weaker than the word "hashed" sounds, and it is the honest description.
  - **The operator gains a participation graph.** Content stays unreadable, and the operator now learns which verified address commented on which relic and when. In some cases that association is more sensitive than the content it hangs off. It sharpens what `docs/spec/service.md` section 5 already discloses, where the operator's picture is a coarse renderer class, a publishing client name, an optional publisher-declared plaintext title, IP-correlated open activity amounting to roughly how often a relic was fetched, and a length leak putting plaintext size within a record: the same picture keyed to a verified address instead of an IP, and joinable across relics.
  - **The service becomes a controller of personal data**, with everything that follows: lawful basis, retention, subject access, erasure, breach notification, and a published privacy statement that now describes email processing rather than telemetry alone.
  - **Verified email buys attribution, not authorization.** Anyone holding the link and any real mailbox can comment. The email proves a reachable mailbox and never entitlement, so nobody downstream reads identity here as access control, because it is not one.
  - **Outbound transactional mail becomes a core-path dependency.** Deliverability, token expiry, replay, address enumeration through the request form, and rate limiting all have to be answered before a comment can be left at all, and a magic link that lands in spam is a broken feature rather than a degraded one.
  - **The compliance position moves, and the obvious version of that claim is wrong.** `shape`'s abuse-operations document, `docs/design/operations.md`, leans in part on the service holding no contact details, and verified commenter addresses change what is true there. It does not follow that the DSA duties that document reads as discharged come back: Article 16(4) and (5) condition on the notice carrying the contact information of whoever submitted the notice, and a commenter is a different party, so those stand where that document put them. Where it might bite is the Article 17 statement-of-reasons duty, which is owed to affected recipients of the service and applies only where the relevant electronic contact details are known to the provider. Whether it attaches turns on who counts as a recipient of the service and on whether a commenter's address is known in the relevant sense. Both are lawyer questions, and this is recorded as one rather than settled: **counsel question 11**, following the ten in that document's section 7.
  - **It licenses no dashboard and no team features.** Identity makes both possible and therefore tempting, and it grants neither: **No dashboard and no "my relics" list** and **No team features** below stand exactly as written, because a verified address is how a comment is attributed and never a surface to log into or a membership to belong to. A later station reading this entry as permission for either is drifting, and that routes back here.
- **No dashboard and no "my relics" list.** There's no logged-in surface to hang one on.
- **Republish-to-same-URL exists, authorized by a bearer publish token rather than identity.** This reverses the original non-goal that a new relic was always a new URL, and the reversal is recorded rather than absorbed: the old entry said versioning needed identity to do safely, and what makes it safe without identity is the token. The first grant returns a `publish_token` once, the server stores only its hash, and whoever presents the token can post a new version to the same ID; opening the relic serves the current version. What it buys is Artifacts' genuine strength, a link that stays stable while its content moves forward, without an account anywhere. What it costs is durable secret state on the publishing machine: the relic's key and token must both be persisted, because a new version has to decrypt under the key already sitting in the shared URL and the token is never issued twice, so only the machine that kept both can ever republish, and a machine that lost them is a spectator to its own relic, exactly like everybody else. A takedown stays terminal across all versions: a tombstoned id refuses every future version with `relic_removed`, whatever token is presented. That rule is what keeps delete-by-ID an abuse control rather than a speed bump, because a takedown an abuser can out-publish is not a takedown, and the moment versioning existed, terminality became the difference between the two.
- **No custom domains.** The domain strategy is a security control, not a branding surface.
- **No team features.** No sharing groups, no org accounts, no permissions.
- **No mandatory TTL.** Relics are kept until deleted. A publisher may set a lifetime at publish time; without one the relic never expires, and the operator cannot impose a lifetime of their own. This reverses the original rule that TTL was mandatory and fixed, and the cost is named rather than absorbed: the storage-side abuse mitigation is gone, the bounded-egress assumption it carried is gone, and what remains as abuse controls is delete-by-ID, the per-object download cap, and the kill switch.
- **No burn-after-reading in the first release.** A Slack unfurl, a Safe Links scanner, or an antivirus mail gateway would fetch the URL and burn the relic before a human ever clicks, producing a stream of "the link is dead" reports that look exactly like a broken product.
- **No first-party rendering of media, archives, or arbitrary binaries.** Download-only in the first release, per the wedge boundary. The framing constraint stays.
