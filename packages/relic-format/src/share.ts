/**
 * The share proof (`spec/format.md` 3.14).
 *
 * A reader can enroll addresses in a relic's change notices from the viewer,
 * and only a holder of the key may do that. The service never sees the key,
 * so it cannot check possession directly. What it can check is a value only a
 * key holder can compute: the publisher's client registers the SHA-256 of a
 * key-derived proof when it publishes or republishes, and a reader presents
 * the proof itself when sharing. The service compares hashes and learns the
 * proof, which decrypts nothing.
 *
 * Another HKDF label off the same 16 bytes the fragment carries, for the same
 * reason the comment key is one (`comments.ts`): the fragment has no room for
 * a second secret, and a distinct label yields a value independent of the
 * content key, the nonce, and the comment key by construction.
 *
 * This package owns it because the publishing client derives the verifier and
 * the viewer derives the proof, and two definitions of either would drift into
 * a share button that is always refused.
