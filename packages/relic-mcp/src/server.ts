/**
 * The MCP server: a local binary, never a remote surface.
 *
 * It holds the key and encrypts in process. It returns no script. That is
 * locked in `docs/frame.md` and it is the single most load-bearing structural
 * decision in the publish path.
 *
 * **Why this cannot be a hosted MCP server**, stated once because it is the
 * question everybody asks: a remote server would have to receive the file to
 * encrypt it, which destroys the product. Zero-knowledge is not a feature
 * layered on top; it is a consequence of the encryption happening on the
 * machine that already has the plaintext. The transport can be stdio or HTTP,
 * but the process runs next to the file either way.
 *
 * Protocol revision `2026-07-28`, which is stateless: no handshake, no
 * session, no `Mcp-Session-Id`. Nothing is retained between calls, so the
 * server can be restarted or run one-shot without a client noticing. The
 * legacy `initialize` handshake is answered too, which the spec calls a
 * dual-era server, because a client that only speaks the newest revision is
 * unusable in most of the agents this product exists to serve.

Seven things that change how you should act:

1. The link is the credential: anyone holding it, fragment included, can read \
the file. Do not paste it into a tracker, log, or public channel.
2. A relic carries a plaintext title, defaulting to the filename, and it is \
not encrypted: the service stores it and every link preview shows it. Pass \
title: "" when the name itself is sensitive.
3. Publishing puts the key in this transcript. That is structural: say so \
plainly when handing the link over.
4. Check sources with relic_lookup_source; relic_republish keeps the URL \
where relic_publish costs a second URL. \
${VERSION_HISTORY_DISCLOSURE}
5. A relic can be republished only from the machine that published it, where \
its key and publish token live. Anywhere else it refuses.
6. HTML and JSX render in an isolated frame with no network access, so inline \
styles, scripts, fonts, and images: a CDN reference renders as nothing.
7. People can comment on a relic. Read with relic_read_comments before \
changing reviewed content, and answer with relic_comment. Both take the \
relic id and attribute you as publisher.`;

 */
export function describeClient(deps: PublishDeps): string {
  return `Relic publishing client, running locally on this machine.

What happens when you publish a file:

1. The file is read from disk by this process. It is never sent anywhere in
   plaintext.
2. A 128-bit key and a 26-character relic id are drawn independently from this
   machine's CSPRNG (crypto.getRandomValues). Neither derives from the other.
3. The file is encrypted here, in this process, with AES-128-GCM under RFC 8188
   aes128gcm framing: an HKDF-derived content key, counter-derived per-record
   nonces, and a per-record authentication tag.
4. Only ciphertext is uploaded, straight to object storage under a signed URL.
   It does not pass through ${deps.serviceOrigin}.
5. The service is told four things and nothing more: a coarse renderer class
   from an eight-value list, the name of this client, the exact byte length
   of the ciphertext, and the title, which defaults to the filename and is
   stored in the clear. Not the mimetype, not the contents.
6. You get back a URL whose fragment carries the key. Fragments are never sent
   to a server by a browser.

What the service operator can see: that a relic exists, roughly how big it is,
what coarse class it was declared as, the title, the publishing IP, and when it
was fetched. Never the contents, and never the key.

What this keeps on disk: for each relic you publish, its id, source identity,
key, and publish token, in a 0600 file under your user config directory. The
source index lets a fresh session find the id for relic_republish. The key and
token let that republish keep the same URL, and they are why republishing works
only on the machine that published. The token's SHA-256 is the only copy the
service ever holds, and neither secret is ever printed or logged. Deleting the
file changes nothing for existing links; it only ends this machine's ability
to update those relics.

What happens with comments: a comment body is encrypted here too, under a key
derived from that relic's key with a distinct HKDF label, so the service
stores comment ciphertext it cannot read and the URL fragment does not change.
Reading comments needs that key, and writing one is authorized by the publish
token, so both work only on the machine that published. A comment this client
writes is attributed to the publisher rather than an email address, because
an agent has no mailbox to verify. What the operator does learn is who
commented on which relic and when: for a person that is a verified email
address, and that association is a real cost the content's encryption does
not cover.

What this does NOT protect against: the key is returned to your agent in the
URL, so it enters the model's context and your session transcript. That is
structural, not a defect. Anyone who can read this conversation can open the
relic.

The code doing all of this is on disk in this package and can be read. Nothing
is fetched from the network and executed.`;
