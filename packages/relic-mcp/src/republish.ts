 * The republish flow: a new version of an existing relic.

 * key the first publish used. That key exists in exactly two places: the
 * URL, and this machine's publish state. The service holds only a hash of
 * the publish token and none of the key, so it cannot help. Republishing is
 * therefore possible only from the machine that published, which is the
 * boundary the state file draws and this flow enforces before any network.
