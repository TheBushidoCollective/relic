/**
 * Comments, from an agent's seat.
 *
 * The feature exists so a person can leave a comment and an agent can read it
 * back and act on it. The agent's half has two constraints the person's does
 * not, and both are structural rather than stylistic.
 *
 * **An agent cannot receive email.** `docs/frame.md` makes a verified email
 * address the commenter identity, and verification runs through a magic link,
 * which needs a mailbox. There is no mailbox here. The publish token already
 * proves this machine published the relic, so it stands as the agent's
 * identity and the service attributes the comment to `publisher`. That is
 * attribution, never authorization: the same non-goal entry says verified
 * email buys attribution and not entitlement, and a bearer token buys less.
 *
 * **The share URL is never an argument.** The fragment is the key, so a tool
 * accepting the URL would put the key in the transcript on every read, which
 * is the one disclosure `spec/publish.md` section 5 spends deliberately and
 * exactly once, at publish. These tools take the relic id and read the key
 * from local publish state instead, which draws the same machine boundary
 * republish already draws: only the machine that published can comment on a
 * relic or read its comments here.
 *
 * The comment key is derived from the fragment's key bytes under a distinct
 * HKDF `info`, so it is independent of the container key by construction, and
 * the fragment does not change. `spec/format.md` 2.1 fixes the fragment at
 * the marker and the key, and a third field would cost a version bump.
