/**
 * The inventory: what this machine has published, and what one relic holds.
 *
 * The gap this closes, measured on the file that prompted it: 41 relics
 * recorded, 4 findable. `relic_lookup_source` searches the source index, the
 * index names four entries, and nothing else enumerates. The key and the
 * publish token for the other 37 were on disk the whole time; no tool could
 * name them. A publisher who lost the source path lost the relic, while
 * holding everything needed to update it.
 *
 * Two structural facts shape everything here.
 *
 * **The envelope holds the name.** A relic's filename and mimetype live
 * inside the encrypted container, so a missing local record is recoverable
 * rather than lost: mint, fetch the first record, decrypt it with the key in
 * local state. That is why a row's filename is `null` only when recovery was
 * actually attempted and actually failed, with the reason attached.
 *
 * **Reaching the service costs one of the relic's opens.** A mint spends a
 * unit of a per-relic download cap that exists to bound egress, and waiting
 * never refills it. So the metered probe runs when it buys something that
 * cannot be had otherwise, and the free one runs when it will do: the comment
 * list is unauthenticated and unmetered, and it distinguishes removed from
 * unknown from unreachable without touching the cap. Recovered names are
 * cached beside the state file so the second listing costs nothing.
 *
 * Nothing here writes the publish state file. It holds the only copy of 41
 * relics' republish rights, it is read-modify-written whole, and two client
 * processes have no lock between them. A read tool that wrote to it could
 * lose an entry, and a lost entry is a relic that can never be updated again.
