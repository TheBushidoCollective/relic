/**
 * The hosted service, used when nothing names another one.
 *
 * **This reverses what this module used to say**, and the old reasoning is
 * kept here rather than deleted because it was not wrong, it was answering a
 * different question. It read: "There is deliberately no default. A
 * placeholder would turn 'you did not configure me' into a DNS failure on the
 * first publish, and a real origin baked into a published tarball would
 * outlive whatever address the service actually has."
 *
 * The first half still holds and is why the default is a real address rather
 * than a placeholder. The second half was the cost of being a product with
 * one hosted address: `relik.link` is not a guess about where the service
 * might live, it is where it lives, and the plugin manifest and the card
 * raster already carry it.
 *
 * What the reversal buys is the thing it was blocking. The hosted service was
 * printing `--env RELIC_SERVICE_ORIGIN=https://relik.link` in its own install
 * instructions, which asks a recipient of a hosted product to configure which
 * host they are using. That belongs in the repository, for somebody running
 * their own.
 *
 * What it costs is a self-hoster who forgets the variable and publishes to
 * the hosted service instead of their own. That is why `relic_publish`
 * returns the URL it created and `relic_describe_client` names the origin it
 * is pointed at: the destination is visible in the answer rather than
 * inferred from a config file nobody re-reads.
