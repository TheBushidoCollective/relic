name: relic
description: Publish a local file as an encrypted, shareable link when someone outside this session needs to see it. Use when the user says "share this", "send this to X", "publish this", "give me a link for this", "make this shareable", or has just been handed a generated report, HTML page, deck, image, or export and needs it somewhere a person can open. Also covers republishing a new version of an existing relic, reading the comments people leave on one and answering them, what the recipient sees, how long a link lives, and what the service can and cannot read.

# Relic

Turn a file on this machine into a URL you can hand to a person.

The file is encrypted here, before anything is uploaded. Only ciphertext
reaches the service. The key lives in the URL fragment, which browsers never
send to a server, so the operator holds bytes they cannot open.

## Publishing

Call `relic_publish` with a filesystem path:

```
relic_publish(path: "/Users/me/Downloads/report.html")
```

It takes a **path, not content**. That is deliberate: the plaintext never
enters the conversation, so it is never in the transcript, never in a model
context window, and never in whatever stores those. Do not read a file into
context and pass its text; pass where it lives.

When the task is to update the same source, call `relic_lookup_source` first:

```
relic_lookup_source(path: "/Users/me/Downloads/report.html")
```

It reads local machine state only. If the source was published before, it
returns the relic id and the exact `relic_republish` call. This works across
Git worktrees and clones of the same remote, so a fresh session does not need
to retain the id from the first publish.

Do not publish an update as a new relic. That costs a second URL that nobody
holding the first one will ever see. `relic_publish` enforces this: when local
state matches the source, it refuses and points to `relic_republish`.

Anyone holding a relic's link can fetch every version it has ever held, so
republishing does not withdraw earlier content. Republishing moves the artifact
forward without retracting what came before. Deleting the relic still removes
every version.

Optional arguments worth knowing:

- `filename` overrides the display name shown to the recipient.
- `title` sets a plaintext title shown in link previews and in the browser
  tab. It defaults to `filename`. It is NOT encrypted: the service stores it
  and anyone who fetches the link sees it, with or without the key. Pass `""`
  to publish without a title.
- `ttl_days` gives the link a lifetime in days, 1 to 3650. A relic is kept
  until it is deleted unless you set one. Shorter is better for anything
  sensitive: when the content should stop being available, say when.
- `force_new` deliberately creates a separate relic from a source this machine
  already published. Use it only when two independent URLs are the goal, never
  to get past the update refusal.

The result reports the relic as version 1 and its id. The client records that
id with the source locally, so a later session can recover it with
`relic_lookup_source`.

## Finding what you published, and reading it back

`relic_lookup_source` only answers when you are holding the file. For every
other question, start with the inventory:

```
relic_list()
```

It is the only tool that enumerates. Every relic this machine published comes
back newest first, with its name, version, lifetime, status, and share URL,
whether or not its source path was ever recorded. On the machine this was
built for, the source index named 4 of 41 relics; the other 37 had a key and a
publish token on disk and no tool that could say their names.

Four things about a row:

- **A name that was never recorded is recovered, not guessed.** It lives
  inside the relic's encrypted envelope, so the client mints, reads the first
  record, and decrypts it here. When that fails the name is `null` with the
  reason attached. Nothing is inferred from a relic id.
- **Nothing is dropped.** A relic the service will not serve is listed with
  what happened: removed, expired, its opens exhausted, or the service
  unreachable. A short list would read as having published less.
- **Each row is a credential.** The share URL includes the fragment, which is
  the key, so a listing puts every one of those keys in the transcript. That
  is the point of the row and worth saying when you paste one.
- **Reaching the service spends one of a relic's finite opens.** Recovered
  names are cached locally, so a repeat listing spends none. `verify: true`
  asks about every relic and costs an open each; `refresh: true` re-reads
  every name.

Then read one back before you change it:

```
relic_show(relic_id: "0a2c...", include_content: true)
```

That returns what the link currently serves, decrypted here, plus how many
versions the service holds. Do this before `relic_republish` on anything you
did not just write. Republishing replaces what the link serves outright, so
without reading it first the edit is blind: you would be rewriting from memory
for everyone already holding the URL.

## Republishing

Call `relic_republish` with the relic id and a new file:

```
relic_republish(relic_id: "0a2c...", path: "/Users/me/Downloads/report-v2.html")
```

The new file becomes version 2, then 3, and so on, encrypted under the same
key as version 1. **The share URL does not change**: everyone holding the
existing link now sees the new content, and there is no new link to hand out.
`relic_id` is the 26-character id the original publish returned, not the URL.
Optional `filename` overrides the display name in the new version; optional
`title` replaces the plaintext title (pass `""` to remove it).

Two things to know before promising an update:

- **Republishing works only on the machine that published.** The key and the
  publish token are recorded locally when the first publish happens, in a
  0600 file under the user's config directory. On any other machine the tool
  refuses: the relic was published from another machine and cannot be
  republished here. Neither secret is ever printed or logged.
- **A takedown is terminal.** If the relic was removed, republishing cannot
  revive it, ever, whatever token is presented. The tool says so plainly;
  publish the content as a new relic instead.

A relic's lifetime is set at its first publish and carries across versions
unchanged.

## Comments

People can comment on a relic, and that is the only way a reader can answer
back: there is no reply-to, no dashboard, and no notification. So read them.

```
relic_read_comments(relic_id: "0a2c...")
```

Read them **before** you change content somebody was asked to review, and read
them again after you hand a link over and come back to the task. A comment
that nobody read is the same as a comment nobody left, except somebody spent
the effort.

Answer with:

```
relic_comment(relic_id: "0a2c...", body: "Fixed the chart, republished as version 3.")
```

Four things to know:

- **Both work only on the machine that published the relic.** The comment key
  is derived from that relic's key, which lives in the same local 0600 file as
  the publish token. On any other machine they refuse, for the same reason
  `relic_republish` does, and no retry changes it.
- **Pass the relic id, never the URL.** The URL carries the key in its
  fragment. Passing it would put the key in the transcript again for nothing.
  The tools refuse a URL and say so.
- **Your comment is attributed to the publisher, not to a person.** A human
  commenter verifies an email address through a magic link and that address is
  their identity. You have no mailbox, so the publish token stands in and the
  comment reads as `publisher`. Optional `display_name` puts a label beside it;
  it decorates the attribution and never replaces it.
- **A comment that will not decrypt comes back marked unreadable**, with a
  count. That is not noise to filter out: it means part of the conversation is
  unread. Say so rather than acting as though the readable ones are all of it.

Comment bodies are encrypted on this machine, so the service stores ciphertext
it cannot read. What it does learn is who commented on which relic and when,
which for a human commenter is a verified email address. Worth saying plainly
if somebody asks what commenting costs them: the content stays private and the
participation does not.

## Say this when you hand over the link

**The key is in the URL, and the URL is now in the transcript.** Anyone with
this conversation can open the file. That is structural, not a bug being fixed
later: returning a usable link is the product, and a usable link contains the
key.

So the honest framing for the user is: zero-knowledge holds against whoever
runs Relic. It does not hold against their model provider, or anyone who can
read their session history. If the content should not be in a transcript at
all, it should not go through an agent.

Also worth one line, unprompted, the first time in a session:

- a relic is kept until it is deleted, unless it was published with a
  `ttl_days` lifetime, in which case the tool returns the exact date
- opens are capped, and the tool's mint response reports how many remain
- anyone with the link can read it; there are no per-recipient permissions

## What the recipient gets

A page that fetches the ciphertext, decrypts it in their browser, and renders
by type. Markdown, code, images, and plain text render inline. HTML and JSX
render in a sandboxed frame on a separate origin, so a published page cannot
reach the key or the service. Anything else offers a download.

That frame has **no network access**: its policy permits no remote source at
all, so a page cannot fetch, beacon, or load an external image, font, or
script. Inline what a page needs when you generate it, because a CDN
reference renders as nothing. The upside is that a relic cannot phone home or
learn the recipient's IP address.

They need the whole URL including the `#...` part. A link truncated at the `#`
is a page that cannot decrypt anything, and that is the most common way sharing
fails: chat clients and ticket systems sometimes cut fragments.

## When not to use it

- **Something that belongs in the repo.** Commit it. A relic is a link you
  hand someone, not a place work lives; the repo is.
- **A client deliverable.** Those have a durable home, and a share link is
  not it, even one with no expiry. Publish a relic in addition if someone
  needs to look at it now, never instead.
- **Credentials, keys, or tokens.** Encrypted in transit and at rest still ends
  with a secret sitting in a URL in a transcript.

## Checking what the client does

`relic_describe_client` returns the client's own account of what it uploads and
what it withholds, plus the service it is pointed at. Use it when the user asks
what is actually being sent, rather than paraphrasing this file. The published
source is one file and is deliberately unminified, so "read it yourself" is a
real answer.
