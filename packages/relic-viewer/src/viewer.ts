 * What `spec/format.md` section 5 hands this unit, in order:
 *
 * - The fragment is read once and stripped via `history.replaceState` (2.5),
 *   which obliges a copy-link affordance and a dead-page state after reload.
 * - The viewing origin sends `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` (section 0).
 * - The renderer class never routes (3.6), and the declared-versus-sniffed
 *   disagreement rule runs against the envelope header's declared mimetype
 *   and filename.
 * - Unknown versions refuse in both places (3.7), and `idlen != 0` refuses
 *   after the fetch (3.4).
 * - A decrypt failure does not mean "wrong key" (3.5).
