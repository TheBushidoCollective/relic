/**
 * How a comment's anchor becomes something a reader can see and aim.
 *
 * `@relic/format` settles what an anchor *is* on the wire. This settles what
 * the page does with one, and it exists as a registry rather than a switch
 * for a reason that is structural rather than stylistic.
 *
 * Four separate places used to branch on the anchor kind: the chip that says
 * what the next comment is about, the provisional mark, the posted marks, and
 * the controls that capture a target. A fifth kind meant editing four
 * switches, and every surface that wanted one was editing the same 3,000-line
 * module. With five kinds arriving at once that is not a style problem, it is
 * a merge that cannot be done safely.
 *
 * So each kind owns one adapter and the four call sites consult the table.
 * Adding a kind is a new file plus one row.
 *
 * ## The coordinate rule
 *
 * Geometry is measured against the annotated element's own content box, never
 * the stage. The existing `pin` is stage-relative and it is kept that way
 * because it is already stored that way; everything new uses the content box.
 * The difference is not cosmetic: an image is letterboxed inside the stage,
 * so the same unit point lands on a different part of the picture at a
 * different viewport width, which moves a mark off the thing it was placed on
 * between the writer's screen and the reader's.
 */

 * stage. They differ whenever the artifact does not fill the stage, which is
 * most of the time and is exactly the case the content-box rule exists for.
