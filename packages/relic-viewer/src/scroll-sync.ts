/**
 * Keeping two comparison panes on the same part of the document.
 *
 * Each `.compare-pane` is its own scroll container, in both the side-by-side
 * and the swipe layout. Independently scrolled, the two stop being a
 * comparison: side by side you end up reading section 12 against section 3,
 * and under the swipe, where the panes are overlaid and clipped, the revealed
 * strip shows a different part of the document than the strip it covers.
 *
 * The tree diff now supplies the smarter mapping this originally said did not
 * exist: one id shared by the two changed nodes it paired. Where a paired mark
 * is visible, that exact content lands at the same viewport top on both sides.
 * Between paired regions the mapping stays proportional rather than pixel for
 * pixel, because the two sides are different documents. A version that gained
 * a section is taller than the one it is compared against, so mirroring pixels
 * runs one pane out of scroll while the other still has room. Proportional is
 * also the fallback near either end, where putting a landmark at the requested
 * top can be physically impossible and the start and end invariants win.
