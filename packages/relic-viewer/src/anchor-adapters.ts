/**
 * The built-in anchor adapters, installed in one place.
 *
 * Two things this file exists to prevent.
 *
 * **Self-registration on import.** If each adapter module called
 * `registerAnchorAdapter` at its own top level, the table's contents would
 * depend on import order and on whether the bundler kept a module it could
 * not see a use for. A mark that fails to paint because of tree shaking is a
 * defect with no symptom at the call site, and it would appear only in the
 * built bundle, never in a test.
 *
 * **A test emptying the table for every later test.** `resetAnchorAdapters`
 * is a real test seam and the table is process-wide, so a unit test that
 * clears it to install stubs leaves every subsequent file in the same run
 * with no adapters. That is not hypothetical: it produced a failure that
 * passed when its file ran alone and failed in the full suite, where the
 * composer chip read "Commenting on something this page cannot show" for a
 * quote that had an adapter the whole time. A test seam whose blast radius is
 * the rest of the run is worse than no seam, so anything that resets the
 * table calls this to put it back.
 *
 * Installation is therefore a replacement rather than an addition: this
 * module knows the complete built-in set, so it can state the whole table
 * rather than append to whatever was there.
 *
 * Registration order is the documented tie-break when two adapters claim one
 * kind, so the order of these calls is behaviour and not style. More specific
 * surfaces go first: an adapter that only accepts a framed document must be
 * asked before one that accepts the page's own DOM, because the second would
 * otherwise answer for content it cannot reach.
