/**
 * The service worker.
 *
 * It exists to make the viewer installable and to survive a bad connection.
 * It caches the app shell and **nothing else**, and that boundary is a
 * privacy control rather than a performance choice.
 *
 * Three things are never cached, ever:
 *
 * 1. **Relic ciphertext.** The signed download URL is short-lived by design,
 *    and the whole point of the TTL and the per-object cap is that content
 *    stops being reachable. A cache entry would quietly outlive both, on the
 *    recipient's disk, past a takedown.
 * 2. **Mint responses.** They carry a signed URL and a remaining-cap count,
 *    both of which are correct only at the instant they were issued.
 * 3. **Anything under `/api/`.** Same reason, stated as a path rule so a new
 *    endpoint inherits it without anybody remembering to.
 *
 * Previously, this file used a hand-maintained constant ('relic-shell-v1')
 * with a comment to bump on every deploy. Because nothing bumped it, deploys
 * never changed the sw.js bundle, install never re-ran, and returning visitors
 * remained pinned to whichever shell version they first cached.
 *
 * Even worse, sw.ts re-exported isCacheable so unit tests could import it,
 * causing the bundler to emit export syntax in sw.js. Because register-sw.js
 * registers a classic service worker, browsers rejected the script with a
 * syntax error during initial evaluation before a single event listener was
 * attached, and a bare catch swallowed the rejection.
 *
 * The rules and lifecycle helpers now live in sw-cache.ts, imported here without
 * re-exporting. This file is built as an IIFE classic script with zero export
 * statements and zero top-level imports.
 *
 * The cache name is derived at build time from a content hash of the emitted
 * shell assets (viewer.js, styles.css, manifest.webmanifest). When any shell
 * asset changes, the build injects a new build hash, altering SHELL_CACHE
 * and producing byte-different sw.js output. The browser sees the changed
 * sw.js on navigation or update check, runs install to fetch the new asset set
 * into the new cache generation, calls skipWaiting, and on activate purges
 * every older generation while claiming clients.
 *
 * This preserves generation atomicity wholesale: a reader never runs a new
 * viewer.js against an old styles.css. Per-request background revalidation
 * (stale-while-revalidate) in the fetch handler is deliberately omitted
 * because updating individual assets piecemeal would break this atomicity,
 * risking mismatched scripts and stylesheets if one fetch succeeds while
 * another fails. All shell updates proceed strictly through the service worker
 * install and activate lifecycle.
