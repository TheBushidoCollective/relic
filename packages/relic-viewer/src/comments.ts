/**
 * The comment thread's core, with no DOM in it, so every rule below is

 *
 * 1. **The thread lives on the service origin, never in the render frame.**
 *    The frame is network denied, `default-src 'none'` with sandbox exactly
 *    `allow-scripts`, so it could not fetch a comment if it wanted to. The
 *    chrome around it can.
 * 2. **Bodies are ciphertext to the server.** It stores and returns them and
 *    cannot read them, so `GET` needs no authorization: anyone holding the
 *    link can already read the content, and the bodies are opaque.
 * 3. **The address is the identity and it is public to link holders.** That is
 *    `frame.md`'s reversal, and its price. The composer states it before a
 *    reader submits, not after.
 * 4. **The fragment never leaves the browser.** Not to request a magic link,
 *    not on the return path, not in a body or a query string. Everything the
 *    round trip needs is the relic id, which the server already has.
