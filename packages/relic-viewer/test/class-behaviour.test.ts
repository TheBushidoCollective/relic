/**
 * Assert routeForClass and CLASS_BEHAVIOUR agree across every renderer class.
 *
 * The server writes a sentence telling a recipient what opening this link will
 * do. It reads that outcome from CLASS_BEHAVIOUR, while routeForClass in the
 * viewer is what actually happens when the recipient opens the link.
 *
 * When they disagree, the card makes a false statement to a recipient on an
 * unfamiliar domain, which is the failure the card exists to prevent. A failure
 * in this test means the server copy and the viewer routing have drifted apart.
 *
 * This test is a correction of a shipped defect: media was described as
 * downloading because isRenderable was used as a description of the viewer.
 * The viewer routes media to an in-browser audio or video player rather than
 * downloading it to the device, so the card told recipients the wrong thing.
