/**
 * The chain that gives the sandboxed frame its height.
 *
 * Rendered geometry belongs in a browser. What is checkable here is the chain,
 * and the chain is what broke twice in one day, in opposite directions.
 *
 * First, `height: calc(100vh - var(--bar-height))` guessed the taskbar, which
 * carries a min-height, so the frame came out taller than the row and the row
 * grew a scrollbar beside the iframe's own.
 *
 * Then the fix for that put the flex container on `.stage` and the fill on the
 * frame, skipping the `.doc` wrapper that `renderSandboxedHtml` puts between
 * them. The flex properties applied to something that was not a flex child and
 * did nothing, while the height they replaced was the only thing sizing the
 * iframe, which collapsed to its intrinsic 300x150 in production.
 *
 * So this file checks the whole chain, element by element, rather than any one
 * declaration in it.
