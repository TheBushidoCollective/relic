/**
 * Viewing an earlier version that cannot be compared.
 *
 * The reported defect: a reader opens an earlier version, Relik cannot show
 * it beside the current one, and the reader is shown a sentence explaining
 * that instead of the version they asked for. The version they asked for is
 * the thing they came for. The comparison was the bonus.
 *
 * Three causes produce it and all three are covered here, because fixing the
 * one that was noticed would leave the other two.
 *
 * The taskbar assertions live in `version-diff-ui.test.ts`, which already
 * carries a DOM stub; a second stub here would drift from that one.
